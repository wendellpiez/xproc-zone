                <p>XProc being XML, it is well suited for processing in XProc. <a href="xproc-lab/index.html">Here</a> we use XProc to make useful things for XProc.</p>

                <h2>For developers</h2>
                <p>Software developers working with the XML/XDM stack may find the Zone interesting
                    as a testbed. The Zone seeks to foreground realistic and meaningful examples
                    demonstrating the power of the two driving design features of this technology,
                    in combination:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <em>transparency</em> and <em>intelligibility</em> of declarative
                        encoding bound to both generalized and local (peculiar) semantics, as
                        exemplified in XML, XProc and kindred technologies (XSLT, XPath, RNG and
                        others)</li>
                    <li>The <em>determinism</em> of the pipelined, template-based processing model,
                        with its implied <em>demonstrability</em> and <em>repeatability</em>, making
                        it testable, validable and (at least potentially) <em>trustworthy</em></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Zone is also more than a platform for demonstrations. Not everything in the
                    repository is equally well documented, or finds its way onto the portal. Deep in
                    the Zone you might find easter eggs or other small treasures.</p>
                <p>Any developers who wish to engage, or anyone who wishes to help sustain and
                    promote XProc Zone, are invited to contact the proprietor or reach out through
                    Github channels.</p>
                <p>If you wish only to study, borrow and learn: the Zone is for you too.</p>
