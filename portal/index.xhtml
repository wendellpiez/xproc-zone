                <p>See an <a href="fm6-22/index.xhtml">electronic version of the army field manual
                        on Leadership Development</a>, converted from an HTML export from PDF, using
                    XProc and XSLT.</p>
                <p>This project was ported and adapted from an <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-xproc3">earlier effort</a> at NIST, the National
                    Institute for Standards and Technology. The Zone adds only the <a class="clean" href="fm6-22/FM_6-22-draw_one.html">Draw</a> feature
                    with some improved styling.</p>

            <h2>For developers</h2>
            <p>Software developers working with the XML/XDM stack may find the Zone interesting as a
                    testbed. The Zone seeks to foreground realistic and intelligible examples that
                    demonstrate the power of combining the two driving design features of this
                    technology:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The <em>transparency</em> and <em>intelligibility</em> of declarative encoding
                        bound to both generalized and local (peculiar) semantics, as exemplified In
                        XML, XProc and kindred technologies (XSLT, XPath, RNG and others)</li>
              <li>The <em>determinism</em> of the pipelined, template-based processing model, with
                        its implied <em>demonstrability</em> and <em>repeatability</em>, making it
                        testable, validable and <em>trustworthy</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>Any developers who wish to engage, or sponsors who wish to motivate this effort,
                are invited to contact the proprietor or reach out through Github
                    channels.</p>
                <p>If you wish only to study, borrow and learn: the Zone is for you too.</p>
