               <summary>Field Manual 6-22 and this project</summary>
               <p>US Army Field Manual 6-22, <b>Developing Leadership</b>, is a foundational document of unacknowledged importance whose influence is difficult to gauge, but immense. Updated and refined over decades, it represents in a highly evolved form the efforts and aspirations of generations of leaders and patriots, to pass on hard-won knowledge where it most matters to do so.</p>
               <p>Today, ADP 6-22 and ADRP 6-22, proposing a comprehensive model of leadership, succeed FM 6-22 in the current publication series. FM 6-22 itself has a long and illustrious history through many editions. The offering on this site transcribes a part (Chapter 4) of the FM 6-22 edition of 2022. (<em>Note: since this project was completed, FM 6-22 has been updated again. Don't expect the text here to be fully up to date.</em>)</p>
               <p>The project presented here originated at the <a href="https://www.nist.gov">National Institute for Standards and Technologies</a> as an <a href="https://github.com/usnistgov/oscal-xproc3">open-source demonstration</a> of technology standards at work. Implicitly, it makes the case for the document's importance by presenting this work in a form that invites comparison and relation to similarly important publications, whether government agency publications or others. (It is not incidental that the XML technology stack has foundations developed in the US Departments of Defense and Energy, among others.) One example of this is the set of NIST guidelines published as <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final">Special Publication 800-53</a>, <b>Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations</b>.</p>
               <p>The commonality is illustrated by converting the publication, originally designed for the printed page and released in PDF, into two legible and workable XML-based formats. These are suitable not only for publication, on screen or paper media, but also for reuse and reconfiguration in ways that serve the needs of its readers and consumers of every description.</p>
               <p>Why two target formats? Interestingly, another principle is illustrated in this project, namely the <em>complementarity</em> of technical standards. Where two such languages, as systems of document description, converge on domain semantics - a way of saying they have certain family resemblances - one standard becomes a springboard to another. In this project, producing <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/sts">NISO STS XML</a> from the raw data makes it easier to produce the second, more rigorous target, namely <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/">OSCAL</a>.</p>
               <p>This paradox becomes familiar, once we enter a realm of free interchange between not only data, but data encoding standards and technologies. When we <q>do the right thing</q> and make a document available in one standard encoding, this makes it easier to acquire in others.</p>
               <p>Consequently, while it is possible to imagine an audience for the Field Manual as such and for itself, it is also possible to imagine an audience whose interest is not in this document in particular, but in all such or similarly structured documents.</p>
               <p>This scope of interest is very broad.</p>

            <h2>Process results: the STS XML for Chapter 4</h2>
            <p>The pipeline produces an interim result in the form of compliant <a href="https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/sts">NISO STS XML</a>, a tag set designed to support standards documentation. As an STS example, this file can be saved and studied. For a rendering, use STS software such as the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/xslt-blender/sts-viewer/">STS Viewer</a> at NIST. A good information source on STS is the (community-supported) <a href="https://www.niso-sts.org/">Supporting Materials</a> page.</p>
            <p>The conversion pipeline making this XML from HTML sources shows, among other things, how XProc can apply heuristic logic to flawed or problematic (<q>broken</q>) data to interpolate and represent latent structures.</p>
            <p>Also visible in this example is an interesting case of conceptual overlap across structural levels. The numbered paragraphs within Chapter 4 together make a sequence spanning across the hierarchy of the parts that contain them.</p>

         <section class="panel">
            <h2>Process results: OSCAL XML</h2>
            <p>From the STS, a pipeline can build an <a href="https://github.com/wendellpiez/xproc-zone/blob/main/projects/USArmy_FM6-22/FM_6-22-OSCAL-working.xml">OSCAL version</a> with no information loss, transposing STS organization and labels into <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/">OSCAL</a>. Still capturing the full text of the chapter, this markup is more highly structured and formalized than earlier versions, describing the work as an OSCAL <b>catalog</b>, or set of security controls, considered in a broad sense.</p>
            <p>In particular, information that remains in tabular form in the STS version can be given a more semantic expression (tagging) in its OSCAL expression. The mapping between the original sections of Chapter 4 into a sequence of OSCAL controls (or in fact, into two separate and juxtaposed sequences) is instructive and useful, shedding light on the intellectual organization and composition of the original text as it was conceived, authored and edited by teams of skilled professionals.</p>
            <p>To study and compare any of these XML files, try using the <a href="https://wendellpiez.github.io/XMLjellysandwich/docuscope/">Docuscope</a> client-side (browser) application.</p>

               <li>To run conversion from an exported HTML version into STS and OSCAL</li>
               <li>To run conversions producing rendered (clean, reusable) web versions from the OSCAL version, taking advantage of its relatively rigorous and clean data description.</li>

            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>Generations of dedicated soldiers and civilians have contributed to writing and producing this work in its editions. If writing a document like this is what an army does in peacetime, we need more of it.</p>
            <p>This work is largely ported from an earlier project performed at NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology), ITL/CSD, as a contribution to the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/">OSCAL initiative</a>. While not the intended beneficiary - that being the reader - the developer would like to thank these sponsors and the US taxpayer for enabling this effort to demonstrate the viability and use of non-proprietary technical standards for document production and publication.</p>
            <p>Thanks to MF for alerting the developer to the existence of FM 6-22.</p>

            <p>On line, FM 6-22 flashcards have been seen, and you can pay money to buy a copy of the complete document - written and produced at US taxpayers' expense - from online vendors.</p>
