Criteria for selection
  NOT archiving for the sake of archiving (we can do that somewhere else)
  rather: does it extend the zone? 'curiosity quotient'? might we wish to use it for its own sake, and not just for the tech?
  is putting it in the Zone as easy as (say) in PellucidLiterature?
    (the Zone has GHA ...)
